### How to identify the problem is going to be solved with the recursion or not
- Try to break it down into smaller problems
- If you can break the problem down, into smaller problem then you can solve the problem using recursion
- Try to find out the recursive tree
-------------

How to understand approach of problem
1. Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problem
2. Write the recurrence relation
3. Draw the recursive tree
